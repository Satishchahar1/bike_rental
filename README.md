General Information
Objectives:
The goal of this project is to build a multiple linear regression model to predict bike rental demand (cnt) and identify significant factors affecting this demand. These insights can help the business:

Improve Demand Forecasting: Accurately predict daily demand for efficient resource allocation.
Understand Influential Factors: Identify weather, seasonal, and temporal variables that impact bike rentals.
Support Business Strategies: Enable better planning to cater to customer needs post-pandemic.
Focus of Analysis:
Assessing relationships between meteorological, temporal, and demand variables.
Evaluating the impact of categorical variables like weather and season on demand.
Building and validating a robust linear regression model.
Conclusions
The analysis uncovered several key insights and actionable recommendations:

Seasonal Demand Patterns:

Demand peaks during summer and fall, with winter showing the least activity.
Recommendation: Plan promotional activities during low-demand seasons.
Weather's Role in Rentals:

Clear weather is highly correlated with higher rentals, while snowy or rainy conditions lead to significant drops.
Recommendation: Offer discounts or incentives during adverse weather.
Temperature and Demand:

Temperature (temp) and feeling temperature (atemp) are strong predictors of demand.
Recommendation: Use weather forecasts to anticipate demand spikes and ensure adequate bike availability.
Yearly Trends:

Bike rentals increased significantly in 2019 compared to 2018.
Recommendation: Leverage this growth trend to expand operations in high-demand areas.
Residual Analysis:

Residuals are normally distributed, confirming model reliability.
Recommendation: Continue using linear regression as a baseline model for forecasting.
